# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

#Overall I didnt not have too many issues past the normal amount of google foo on some errors stemming from not using the correct syntaxs. 
The only issue I never could fix was the object has no attribute error when attempting to make the summary statistic dataframe. I was planning on trying to fix this after class but I am on break and already totally wiped out and have to be up early for work. Im just going to turn it in as is and figure out the error when I get off tomorrow. Overall I enjoyed the challenges and the opportunity to display data visually simply with code.
